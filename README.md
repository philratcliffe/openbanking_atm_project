# Open Banking ATMs

## Overview
Just a simple test app to play with the open banking API. Gets ATM info from
a bank and presents it in different ways.  At the moment, just shows a map with
ATM location markers and the ATM data in formatted JSON.

## Running the Django development server

```bash
$python manage.py runserver --settings=openbanking_atm_project.settings.local
```
